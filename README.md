## Description

This project is a response to the Twitter challenge presented by getLinked.ai. The challenge involved designing and implementing a landing page for the startup called "getLinked." The landing page is aimed at connecting fellow developers, enabling them to interact, create teams for product development, find work opportunities, and more. The project was developed using React, Tailwind CSS, the Fetch API for API integration, React Router for routing, and Vite for the development environment. Additionally, ChatGPT was used for code optimization to enhance the project's overall quality.
